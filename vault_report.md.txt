Impact


The service is an Azure Key Vault instance that requires Azure AD bearer tokens. No secret disclosure observed during these read‑only probes. The discovery should be added to asset inventory and access reviewed.


Recommendations (non‑intrusive)


Restrict network access:

Prefer Private Endpoint or Key Vault firewall/VNet rules to limit access to authorized networks.



Enforce least‑privilege:

Review Azure RBAC roles and Key Vault access policies; remove excessive permissions.



Logging & monitoring:

Enable diagnostic logs (send to Log Analytics / Event Hub / Storage). Alert on repeated 401/403 from unusual IPs.



Protection & hygiene:

Enable soft‑delete and purge‑protection.

Rotate keys/secrets if there is any suspicion of exposure.



Inventory & authorization:

Document vault in asset inventory and audit service principals / app registrations that have access.




Next steps (for ops)


If you want, fetch tenant OIDC metadata (read‑only) from:
https://login.microsoftonline.com/72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47/.well-known/openid-configuration

(Used to identify auth/token endpoints; safe to query.)

If you have permission to test auth flows, request scoped authorization and a temporary test principal before any auth tests.
